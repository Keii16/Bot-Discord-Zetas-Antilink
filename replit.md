# Discord Anti-Link Bot

## Overview
This is a Discord anti-link bot that prevents non-admin users from sending links in Discord channels, with support for whitelisted channels where links are allowed. The bot is written in Node.js using Discord.js v14.

## Project Architecture
- **Language**: Node.js 20.x
- **Main Dependencies**:
  - `discord.js`: Discord API wrapper for bot functionality
  - `dotenv`: Environment variable management
  - `express`: Web framework (currently not used but available for future web interface)
- **Main Files**:
  - `index.js`: Main bot code with anti-link logic
  - `package.json`: Project dependencies and configuration

## Features
- **Anti-Link Protection**: Automatically deletes messages containing links from non-admin users
- **Whitelist Support**: Allows links in specified channels (configured via channel IDs)
- **Admin Override**: Administrators can send links in any channel
- **Ping Command**: Simple `!ping` command that responds with "Pong üèì"

## Configuration
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Bot token from Discord Developer Portal (stored in Replit Secrets)
